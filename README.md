## Winter 2021 Schedule
- Week 1 (Kris): Getting Organized
	- Homework:
	- Sign up for a Github account
	- Create a sample repository
	- Take a look at the [markdown guidelines](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) (I promise, it is super easy)
- Week 2 (Wesley): [Prospects for a (Semi-)Automated Papuan Comparative Linguistics and Reconstruction (Hammarström, 2019)](https://github.com/kristopherkyle/Corpus-Linguistics-Working-Group/raw/main/docs/Hammarstr%C3%B6m_2019.pdf)
- Week 3 (Masaki): [A corpus-driven approach to formulaic language in English
Multi-word patterns in speech and writing (Biber, 2009).](https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ijcl.14.3.08bib) Note, skim this article for background; Workshop will be extracting formulaic language beyond n-grams.
- Week 4 (Keegan): [Galves et al. 2017: Annotating a Polysynthetic Language](https://github.com/kristopherkyle/Corpus-Linguistics-Working-Group/raw/main/docs/Galves_et_al_2017.pdf)
- Week 5 (Cece): [Corpora, Databases, and Internet Resources: Corpus Phonology with Speech Resources Using The Internet For Collecting Phonological Data Speech Manipulation, Synthesis, and Automatic Recognition in Laboratory Phonology Phonotactic Patterns in Lexical Corpora](https://github.com/kristopherkyle/Corpus-Linguistics-Working-Group/raw/main/docs/ColeHasegawa-Johnson_Handbook_Laboratory_Phonology_Ch19.pdf)
- Week 6 (Shayleen): [Corpus linguistics and language documentation: challenges for collaboration (Cox, 2011)](https://github.com/kristopherkyle/Corpus-Linguistics-Working-Group/raw/main/docs/Cox_2011.pdf)
- Week 7 (Brittany): [Annotating the ICE corpora pragmatically –
preliminary issues & steps (Weisser, 2017)](https://github.com/kristopherkyle/Corpus-Linguistics-Working-Group/raw/main/docs/ICE_corpus_pragmatics.pdf)
- Week 8 (Ksenia): [Distributional Semantics article (Boleda, 2019) + word2vec coding in class](https://github.com/kristopherkyle/Corpus-Linguistics-Working-Group/raw/main/docs/Boleda_2019_word2vec.pdf)
- Week 9 (Min): Min will be leading us through a collexeme analysis. For more about collexeme analysis check out [Gries et al., 2005 - focus on study 2](https://github.com/kristopherkyle/Corpus-Linguistics-Working-Group/raw/main/docs/Gries Hampe Shonfeld 2005.pdf) and/or [Hilpert, 2006 - shorter paper](https://github.com/kristopherkyle/Corpus-Linguistics-Working-Group/raw/main/docs/Hilpert_2006_DCCA.pdf)
- Week 10 (Sabine): Sabine will be discussing the calculation of syntactic complexity (and in particular, the use of [TAASSC](https://www.linguisticanalysistools.org/taassc.html)). Sabine will be referencing this article: [Kyle & Crossley (2018)](https://github.com/kristopherkyle/Corpus-Linguistics-Working-Group/raw/main/docs/Kyle_Crossley_2018_CX.pdf)
